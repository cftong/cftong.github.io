# About Me

Hey, I'm Chris Tong.

## Who I Am

I'm an offensive security practitioner based in Asia with over seven years of experience breaking into things (legally). My day job involves red teaming, penetration testing, and helping organizations understand their security posture before the bad guys do.

I've had the privilege of working with clients across various sectors—financial services, telecom, government, and academia—helping them identify weaknesses in their networks, web applications, mobile apps, and overall infrastructure.

## What I Do

My work spans across:

- **Red Team Operations** - Simulating real-world adversaries to test detection and response capabilities
- **Network & Infrastructure Testing** - Finding the cracks in internal networks, wireless setups, and external perimeters
- **Web & Mobile App Security** - Hunting for vulns in applications, from classic SQLi/XSS to logic flaws and API issues
- **Exploit Research** - Occasionally diving deep into reverse engineering and exploit development

## Certifications

I hold several industry certifications including OSCP, OSCE, OSMR, eCPTXv2, and CREST CRT/CPSA. But honestly, certs are just proof you can pass exams—real skills come from doing the work.
