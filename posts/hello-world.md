Welcome to Shell & Shadows—my corner of the internet where I document my journey through the world of offensive cybersecurity.

## Why This Blog?

After years of working in the trenches—red teaming, pentesting networks, breaking web apps, and occasionally reversing binaries—I realized I've accumulated a lot of notes, scripts, and lessons learned that mostly just sit in my local folders. It felt like a waste not to share.

This blog is my attempt to:

- **Document what I learn** - Writing forces me to understand things deeper
- **Share practical knowledge** - Real techniques, real scenarios, not just theory
- **Give back to the community** - I've learned so much from others' blogs and writeups

## What You'll Find Here

Expect a mix of:

- **Technical writeups** - Exploit walkthroughs, tool usage, attack techniques
- **Red team tradecraft** - OPSEC considerations, infrastructure setup, evasion tactics
- **Web & mobile security** - Bug hunting approaches, interesting vulns I've encountered
- **Tool development** - Scripts and utilities I build to make life easier
- **Lessons from the field** - War stories and takeaways (all anonymized, of course)

## A Bit About Me

I'm Chris, an offensive security practitioner based in Asia. I've spent the better part of a decade helping organizations understand their security gaps—whether that's through adversary simulation, network pentests, or application security assessments. I hold certs like OSCP, OSCE, OSMR, and a few others, but I believe skills matter more than alphabet soup.

## Let's Connect

If you're into breaking things (ethically), building security tools, or just want to chat about the craft—feel free to reach out. You can find my contact info on the [About](/#/about) page.

Thanks for stopping by. Let's learn something together.
